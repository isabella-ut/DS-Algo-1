#2. Gale / Shapley Implementation

# Call the defined 'preferences' function to create a dictionary of randomly assigned "prefernces" of profs for each stundent and vice versa.
# Here, recall that the defined function takes a list of lists as input, so we don't exactly use the same input structure as the random allocator function.
student_preferences = functions.preferences(data)
prof_preferences = functions.preferences(data[::-1])

# Look at the results. It should be of this structure: student_#: [prof_#, prof_#, prof_#] and vice versa for the profs.
#print(student_preferences)
#print(prof_preferences)


# Either run with defined sets student_pref and prof_pref as below, or pull from "data" (create_data output).


student_pref = {
    'A': ['a', 'b', 'c'],
    'B': ['a', 'c', 'b'],

prof_pref = {
    'a': ['B', 'A', 'C'],
    'b': ['A', 'C', 'B'],
    'c': ['C', 'B', 'A']
}


# Now, try to implement a basic gale/shapley allocation based on the dictionries of preferences. This uses the list of lists as input and matches according to the above create set of preferences for both parties.
